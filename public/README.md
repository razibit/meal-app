## Required PWA Icons

The following icon files are required for the PWA to function properly:

- `icon-192.png` - 192x192px app icon (for Android home screen and notifications)
- `icon-512.png` - 512x512px app icon (for Android splash screen)
- `badge-72.png` - 72x72px badge icon (for notification badges)
- `favicon.ico` - Browser favicon

## Icon Requirements

- **Format**: PNG with transparency
- **Theme Color**: Use eggplant theme (#5B4B8A) as the primary color
- **Design**: Should represent the mess meal management concept
- **Purpose**: 
  - `any maskable` - Icons should work both as regular icons and maskable icons for Android

## Creating Icons

You can use tools like:
- [PWA Asset Generator](https://github.com/onderceylan/pwa-asset-generator)
- [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/)
- Design tools like Figma, Adobe Illustrator, or Canva

## Temporary Placeholders

Until proper icons are created, you can use placeholder images or generate simple colored squares with the app initials "MM" (Mess Meals).
